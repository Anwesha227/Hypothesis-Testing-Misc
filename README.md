# Hypothesis-Testing-Misc


This repository has multiple notebooks that focus on exploratory analysis, feature engineering and hypothesis testing. 

 1. [Retail.ipynb](https://github.com/Anwesha227/Hypothesis-Testing-Misc/blob/main/Retail.ipynb) notebook : It involves analyzing a retail company data of customer purchase behavior against factors such as : Gender, Age, Marital Status to provide suitable recommendations. This is achieved by constructing confidence intervals for avergae purchase across different categories.

 2. [RideShare.ipynb](https://github.com/Anwesha227/Hypothesis-Testing-Misc/blob/main/RideShare.ipynb) notebook : This notebook tries to understand the factors which could affect the demand of electric cycles of a micro-mobility service provider. We will look at the following questions and try to come up with answers and recommendations :
    
      - Which variables are significant in predicting the demand for shared electric cycles?
      - How well do those variables describe the electric cycle demands?
      - For this purpose, we shall make use of various exploratory visualizations, hypotheses tests and other tests including:
            - 2- Sample T-Test.
            - One-way ANOVA.
            - Chi square test of independence.

      - Additionally we might require checking the assumptions of the some tests (Normality, Equal Variance). For these we will be using:
            - Visualizations like Histogram and Q-Q plot.
            - Statistical methods like leveneâ€™s test (Equality of Variances), Shapiro-wilk test, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (Normality Test).

 3. [InsuranceMedicalData.ipynb](https://github.com/Anwesha227/Hypothesis-Testing-Misc/blob/main/InsuranceMedicalData.ipynb) notebook : We will analyze the insurance company medical records data and answer certain questions such as :

      - Which variables are significant in predicting the reason for hospitalization for different regions.
      - How well some variables like viral load, smoking, Severity Level describe the hospitalization charges.
      - What are some action items/recommendations/business insights that our analysis can yeild.
      
We will perform exploratory data analysis and test for certain hypotheses (for eg. hospitalization costs depend on smoker/non-smoker status) using tests like 2 sample T, One way ANOVA, chi square, etc.

4. [Deliveries.ipynb](https://github.com/Anwesha227/Hypothesis-Testing-Misc/blob/main/Deliveries.ipynb) notebook : We will be looking at the delivery data for a particular shipping company. The two main tasks that we shal perform in this notebook are :

      - Cleaning, sanitizing and manipulating data to get useful features out of raw fields.
      - Making sense out of the raw data to provide business insights/recommendations and to help data science team to build forecasting models on it.

This would involve performing exploratory data analysis, building new features to help in further analysis, testing various hypothesis to gain meaningful insights and finally providing suitable recommendations.
